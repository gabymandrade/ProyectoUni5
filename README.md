This repo consist in a few scrips for download SNPS´s of wolves, this is done by wget.

**The fist script**

It's about how to download the sequences, and hoe to make some directories.


**The second scrip**

It´s about, work in VFTools, this program allows calculate some parameters of genetic of populations like
heterocigocity and nucleotid diversity, thats very important, as well as estimate the number of individuals and SNPs in the file.
Another important point is to convert a vcf file to a plink file.
